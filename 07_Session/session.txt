## ðŸ“Œ Sessions vs Cookies in PHP

### âœ… Whatâ€™s the difference?

| Feature | **Session** | **Cookie** |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Where stored?** | On the **server** | On the **userâ€™s browser** |
| **Data size limit** | Can store more data | Small size limit (~4KB) |
| **Lifetime** | Ends when user closes browser or session expires on server | Can have an expiry date and stay for days, weeks, or more |
| **Access** | Only server can access | Both server and user/browser can access |
| **Use case** | Login state, user info during a visit | Remember user preferences for next visits |
| **Security** | More secure | Less secure |

**ðŸ‘‰ In short:**  
- **Sessions:** Good for sensitive data like login info.  
- **Cookies:** Good for saving simple settings like theme or username.
